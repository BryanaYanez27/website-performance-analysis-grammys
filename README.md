## Overview

This project analyzes website performance data for The Recording Academy to evaluate user engagement and determine whether splitting the website into two separate sites improves interaction with the homepage CTA (watch Grammy highlights).

The analysis combines overall performance insights with an A/B test comparing the original combined site (control) and the split-site version (test).

## Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

PivotTables

Conversion rate analysis

A/B testing significance calculator

## What I Did

Organized and analyzed website performance data in Excel

Built PivotTables to summarize visitors and CTA clicks by group

Calculated conversion rates for control vs test versions

Conducted an A/B test to evaluate differences in engagement

Interpreted results and made a business recommendation

## Key Result

The split website version showed a higher CTA click rate, indicating improved user engagement compared to the original site.

## Recommendation

Based on the results, continuing with the split website structure is recommended because it increases user interaction with Grammy highlights content.
